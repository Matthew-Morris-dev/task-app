# task-app

This application was created with the purpose of learning nodejs, express and RESTAPI
This application does not contain any frontend for interaction, personally I used Insomnia to make http requests to the app.

## Getting Started

1. Create a directory called config at the same level as src.
2. Create a file within config called dev.env
3. Add the following<br>
    `PORT=****`<br>
    `MONGODB_URL=*************`<br>
    `JWT_SECRET=*****************`<br>
Replace the asterisks with your own content.

you can then run the application in development using:<br>
    `npm run dev`
